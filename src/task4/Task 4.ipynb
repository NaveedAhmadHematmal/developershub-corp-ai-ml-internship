      "Here's why:\n",
      "*   **Dehydration** occurs when your body loses more fluids than it takes in. Water is essential for many bodily functions, including maintaining blood volume and electrolyte balance.\n",
      "*   When you're dehydrated, your brain tissue can actually shrink slightly, pulling away from the skull. This can trigger pain receptors, leading to a headache.\n",
      "*   Dehydration can also affect blood flow to the brain and cause blood vessels to narrow, which can also contribute to headaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other general things that can cause headaches** include:\n",
      "*   Heat exhaustion (which is often linked to dehydration)\n",
      "*   Stress or fatigue\n",
      "*   Eye strain\n",
      "*   Skipping meals\n",
      "*   Even certain food sensitivities\n",
      "\n",
      "While dehydration is a very plausible explanation in this scenario, it's really important to remember that I'm an AI and cannot give medical advice or diagnose conditions. If your friend's headache is severe, doesn't improve after rehydrating, or if they experience any other concerning symptoms like dizziness, confusion, or extreme tiredness, **it would be best for them to consult with a doctor or other healthcare professional.** They can properly assess the situation and provide the best advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, encouraging your friend to slowly drink some water or an electrolyte-rich drink might be a good first step, along with resting in a cool place.\n",
